**Overall Philosophy for Refactor:**

1.  **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Ensure classes and functions do one thing well.
2.  **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Abstract common patterns.
3.  **Clarity over Cleverness:** Code should be easy to read and understand.
4.  **Testability:** Design components and functions so they can be unit-tested where possible.
5.  **Progressive Enhancement:** Refactor in stages, ensuring the plugin remains functional.

**Refactor Plan**

Here's a breakdown by area:

-[] Phase 1: Core Abstractions & Parsing Logic**

*   **Goal:** Centralize block definition and parsing. Reduce boilerplate in specific preview extensions.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Unified Block Definition & Parsing:**
        *   **Create a `BlockParserService` (or similar):** This service would be responsible for identifying and parsing Ginko Blocks from the document text.
            *   It would take the document text and a set of "Block Definitions" (see next point).
            *   It would return an array of `ParsedBlock` objects, each containing:
                *   `type`: e.g., "tabs", "aspect", "callout"
                *   `startIndex`, `endIndex`
                *   `rawContent`: The full text of the block.
                *   `innerContent`: The content between the start and end tags.
                *   `properties`: Parsed properties from the start tag (e.g., `::tabs(default="1")` -> `{ default: "1" }`).
        *   **Define `BlockDefinition` objects/interfaces:** Each component would provide a definition:
            ```typescript
            interface BlockDefinition {
              type: string; // "tabs", "aspect"
              startTagPattern: RegExp; // e.g., /^::tabs(?:\(([^)]*)\))?$/
              endTag: string; // e.g., "::"
              // Optional: a more complex parsing function if regex isn't enough
              // parse?: (text: string, startPos: number) => ParsedBlock | null;
            }
            ```
        *   **Refactor `BasePreviewExtension.parseContent()`:** This logic should move into the `BlockParserService`. The `BasePreviewExtension` would use this service.
        *   **Refactor `syntaxHighlightExtension.ts`:** This extension should *also* use the `BlockParserService` (or a shared underlying parsing utility) to identify blocks and their parts (start tag, props, end tag) for styling. This ensures consistent parsing across preview and syntax highlighting.
    2.  **Simplify `BasePreviewExtension`:**
        *   Remove `config.startTag` and `config.endTag`. The extension would be configured with its `blockType` (e.g., "tabs").
        *   The `updatePreviews` method would use the `BlockParserService` to get all blocks, then filter for its `blockType`.
        *   **Generic Toggle Edit Effect:**
            *   In `BasePreviewExtension`, define a single `toggleBlockEditEffect = StateEffect.define<{ blockId: string, blockType: string, value: boolean }>()`.
            *   The `isToggleEditEffect` in `BasePreviewExtension` would check `effect.value.blockType === this.blockType`. Specific extensions wouldn't need to implement this anymore.
            *   Widgets would dispatch this generic effect, including their `blockId` and `blockType`.
        *   **Standardize `processContentBlock`:** Its purpose is currently a bit vague. Clarify its role: Is it for extracting *widget-specific* data from the `innerContent` *before* the widget is created? If so, rename it to something like `prepareWidgetData`. If not essential to the base, make it optional or remove.
        *   **Rename `fieldName` to `blockType` in `PreviewExtensionConfig`:** This is more descriptive.
    3.  **Improve `utils.ts` for Parsing Properties:**
        *   Enhance `parseBlockProperties` to be more robust. Consider handling various value types (booleans, numbers explicitly if needed) or a more structured property format.
        *   Ensure `parseTabProperties`, `parseColumnProperties`, `parseLayoutProperties` are consistent and potentially leverage a core property parsing utility.

*   **Testing Opportunities:**
    *   **`BlockParserService`:**
        *   Unit test with various valid and invalid Ginko Block syntaxes.
        *   Test property parsing within the block tags.
        *   Test handling of nested (though current parsing is basic) and adjacent blocks.
    *   **Property Parsing Utilities:** Unit test `parseBlockProperties` and its variants with diverse inputs.

-[]**Phase 2: Widget Enhancements & Consistency**

*   **Goal:** Standardize widget behavior, improve DOM creation, and make widgets more self-contained regarding their specific content needs.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **`BaseWidget` Improvements:**
        *   **Content Parsing:** Widgets currently parse their own content (e.g., `AspectWidget.parseAspectRatio`, `TabWidget.parseTabs`). This is generally good for SRP within the widget. Ensure this parsing is robust.
        *   **Edit Button Click Handler:** The logic for dispatching the `toggleEditEffect` and positioning the cursor is similar across widgets.
            *   Consider a protected helper method in `BaseWidget`: `protected dispatchEditMode(view: EditorView, cursorPos?: number)` which handles finding the widget's position, calculating a default edit cursor position (e.g., start of inner content), and dispatching the generic `toggleBlockEditEffect`. Widgets could override `cursorPos` calculation if needed.
        *   **`eq()` Method:** Ensure all `eq` methods in specific widgets compare all relevant state for that widget (e.g., `CalloutWidget` now checks `isCollapsed`).
    2.  **Specific Widget Refinements:**
        *   **`AspectWidget`:** `MarkdownRenderer.render()` for just an image is a good trick. Ensure it's efficient.
        *   **`CalloutWidget`:** The collapsed state using `blockState.ts` is good.
        *   **`GalleryWidget`:**
            *   Image meta caching is good.
            *   `organizeIntoRows/Columns` logic could be complex. Review for clarity.
            *   Lightbox implementation: Ensure it's robust and handles edge cases.
        *   **`LayoutWidget` & `StepsWidget`:** These have similar logic for finding the `--col` or `--step` line to position the cursor on edit. Abstract this if possible (perhaps the `dispatchEditMode` helper).
        *   **`TabWidget`:** `activeTab` state management is good.
        *   **`FileTreeWidget`:** Icon loading is asynchronous; ensure it handles errors gracefully and doesn't cause layout shifts if icons load late.
    3.  **DOM Creation & Styling:**
        *   Consistently use `this.createContainer()` from `BaseWidget`.
        *   Review CSS class names for consistency (BEM or similar).
        *   Minimize direct style manipulation in JS; prefer CSS classes.

*   **Testing Opportunities:**
    *   **Widget Content Parsing:** For each widget, unit test its internal content parsing logic (e.g., `TabWidget.parseTabs` with various tab structures).
    *   **`createPreviewView()`:** For simpler widgets, you could try "snapshot testing" the generated DOM structure (comparing HTML output). This is harder for widgets using `MarkdownRenderer` extensively.
    *   **Stateful Widgets:** Test state transitions (e.g., `TabWidget` active tab changes, `CalloutWidget` collapse/expand).
    *   **Edit Button Logic:** Verify that clicking the edit button correctly dispatches the effect and ideally positions the cursor.

-[]**Phase 3: Syntax Highlighting & CSS**

*   **Goal:** Ensure syntax highlighting is consistent with block parsing and CSS is well-organized.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **`syntaxHighlightExtension.ts` Refactor:**
        *   As mentioned in Phase 1, this *must* use the same `BlockParserService` or underlying parsing utilities as the `BasePreviewExtension`. This will eliminate inconsistencies.
        *   The `DecorationManager` is a good pattern.
        *   Clarify the purpose of `CONFIG.patterns.middle` if it's distinct from a regular nested block's start tag.
    2.  **CSS Organization:**
        *   The current `@import` structure in `styles.css` is good for modularity.
        *   **Global Styles/Variables:** Consider a `_variables.css` or `_mixins.css` if there are common colors, spacing, or utility classes used across multiple components.
        *   **Review CSS Specificity:** Ensure styles are not overly specific, making overrides difficult.
        *   **CSS Comments:** Add comments to complex CSS sections or for explaining non-obvious styling choices.

*   **Testing Opportunities:**
    *   **Syntax Highlighting:** Manually verify that all defined block syntaxes (start tags, props, end tags, inline tags) are highlighted correctly and consistently with how they are parsed for live preview. Test edge cases (incomplete tags, tags in code blocks).

-[]**Phase 4: Utilities, Settings, and General Code Quality**

*   **Goal:** Improve organization of utility functions, make settings clearer, and enhance overall code readability.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **`utils.ts` Split:**
        *   This file is getting large. Split it into more focused files:
            *   `src/editor/utils/parsing.ts` (or integrate into `BlockParserService`)
            *   `src/editor/utils/codemirror.ts` (for `checkCursorInRegion`, `getCursorLocations`, etc.)
            *   `src/editor/utils/dom.ts` (for `createIconElement`, etc.)
            *   `src/editor/utils/general.ts` (for `hashContent`, etc.)
    2.  **`blockState.ts`:**
        *   Looks good. The cleanup logic is a nice touch. Ensure all components that need persistent UI state (like active tab, collapsed state) use this consistently.
    3.  **`settings.ts` & `resetModal.ts`:**
        *   The settings UI is well-structured.
        *   The `ResetModal` provides good user warnings. The TODO for actual reset logic is important.
    4.  **Comments:**
        *   **JSDoc/TSDoc:** Add to all public classes, methods, and complex functions. Explain parameters, return values, and purpose.
        *   **Inline Comments:** Add for complex or non-obvious logic within functions.
        *   **File-Level Comments:** Briefly describe the purpose of each file at the top.
    5.  **Naming Conventions:**
        *   Ensure consistency in naming variables, functions, classes, and CSS classes.
        *   Make names descriptive (e.g., `shouldRenderWidgetForBlock` instead of just `shouldProcess`).
    6.  **Error Handling:**
        *   Review `try...catch` blocks. Log errors informatively. Consider if some errors should provide user feedback (e.g., via Obsidian's `Notice`).
    7.  **Type Safety:**
        *   Leverage TypeScript's strengths. Avoid `any` where possible. Define clear interfaces for complex objects.
    8.  **Remove Dead Code:**
        *   The `layoutPostProcessor.ts`, `stepsPostProcessor.ts`, etc., seem to be remnants of a previous approach. If live preview extensions are the primary way these are handled, these post-processors might be redundant or need to be re-evaluated. The current `tabsPostProcessor.ts` is being used. Clarify the strategy: are some components *only* post-processors and others *only* live-preview, or a mix? If a mix, ensure no conflicts. *Based on `main.ts`, `tabsProcessor` is registered, but preview extensions exist for layout and steps.* This needs clarification and simplification. It's likely best to stick to one primary rendering mechanism per block type (either live preview widget OR post-processor in reading view, ideally not both trying to render the same block in edit mode). Live preview is generally preferred for a WYSIWYG feel.
        *   `noLineBreaksExtension.ts`: Its purpose is to trim lines within `::layout ... ::` blocks when the cursor is outside. This seems like a very specific behavior that might be surprising. Evaluate if this is truly necessary or if it can be handled by the widget's rendering or by user discipline. If kept, ensure it's well-documented.

*   **Testing Opportunities:**
    *   **`blockState.ts`:** Unit test `getBlockState`, `setBlockState`, `cleanupExpiredStates`. (Requires mocking `localStorage`).
    *   **Utility functions:** Unit test individual utility functions in `utils.ts` (and its future refactored parts).
    *   **Settings:** Manually test that all settings apply correctly and persist.
    *   **Reset Logic:** Manually test reset functionality once implemented.

-[]**Phase 5: Documentation & Contribution Guide**

*   **Goal:** Make it easy for others (and future you) to understand and contribute to the plugin.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **`README.md` Update:**
        *   Explain the plugin's architecture at a high level.
        *   Describe how to add a new Ginko Block component (the pattern of creating a `...PreviewExtension.ts` and `...Widget.ts`).
    2.  **Inline Code Documentation (JSDoc/TSDoc):** Crucial for explaining the "why" and "how" of different parts.
    3.  **Contribution Guide (`CONTRIBUTING.md`):**
        *   Coding style guidelines.
        *   How to set up the development environment.
        *   Process for submitting changes.

**Suggested Prioritization / Roadmap:**

1.  **Phase 1 (Core Parsing & Abstraction):** This is foundational. Unifying parsing will have the biggest impact on consistency and reducing future bugs.
2.  **General Code Quality (Comments, Naming, Error Handling from Phase 4):** Do this incrementally throughout the refactor.
3.  **Phase 2 (Widget Enhancements):** Focus on standardizing edit button logic and clarifying widget content parsing.
4.  **Phase 3 (Syntax Highlighting & CSS):** Align syntax highlighting with the new parser. Review CSS.
5.  **Address Redundancy (Post-processors vs. Live Preview in Phase 4):** Decide on a consistent strategy.
6.  **`utils.ts` Split (Phase 4).**
7.  **Phase 5 (Documentation):** As you refactor, update documentation.

This is a comprehensive plan. Tackle it in manageable chunks. Each step should ideally leave the plugin in a working state. Good luck!
